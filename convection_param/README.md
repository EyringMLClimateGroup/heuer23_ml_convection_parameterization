# Parameterization developement and analysis
This directory contains the scripts for training as well as validation/testing of the deep learning and non-deep learning models. Furthermore, code for the hyperparamter tuning is provided in `DLHyperOpt.py`/`NDLHyperOpt.py`.

Some further analysis of the dataset, the model evaluation, and online runs are provided in the [analysis](./analysis) directory.

For code related to the calculation and visualization of SHAP values have a look into the [shap_values](./shap_values/) directory.

Trained models are to be found in [saved_models](./saved_models/).
